# StudySync

StudySync is an AI-powered, real-time collaborative study platform.

It combines group chat, shared notes, and AI study tools into a single workspace for students.

## What This Project Does

- User authentication with secure cookie-based JWT sessions.
- Create and discover study groups by subject.
- Join and leave groups.
- Real-time group chat with typing indicators.
- Chat reactions (heart reactions).
- Link sharing in chat.
- File sharing in chat (base64 payloads).
- Collaborative notes editor with auto-save via sockets.
- Notes version history with restore support.
- AI assistant for question answering.
- AI notes summarization.
- AI quiz generation.
- Responsive UI with light/dark theme toggle.

## Architecture Overview

This repository is split into two main apps:

- client: React + Vite frontend.
- server: Express + MongoDB + Socket.IO backend.

At runtime:

- The frontend calls backend REST APIs under /api/*.
- Real-time collaboration is handled through Socket.IO.
- In production-style builds, the backend serves the built frontend from server/public.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React 19
- Vite
- Redux Toolkit
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- Socket.IO Client
- React Quill
- React Markdown + remark-gfm

### Backend

- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Socket.IO
- JWT authentication (httpOnly cookie token)
- LangChain + Mistral AI integration
- Winston logging

## Core Functionality

### Authentication

- Register, login, logout, and profile endpoints.
- JWT token is set in a secure httpOnly cookie.
- Protected routes use middleware that reads req.cookies.token.

### Study Groups

- Create a group with name, subject, description.
- Public group listing for discovery.
- User-specific group listing.
- Group membership join/leave.

### Real-Time Chat

- Join group rooms and receive live messages.
- Message types: text, file, link, ai, system.
- Add and toggle emoji reactions (currently heart reaction flow).
- Typing and stop-typing events.

### Collaborative Notes

- Group notes are synced in real time.
- Auto-save after short debounce.
- Version history stored in noteHistory.
- Restore any previous note version.
- Note history keeps recent versions (up to the latest 10 entries).

### AI Features

- Ask AI questions in group context.
- Summarize notes.
- Generate quiz questions.
- Powered by Mistral through LangChain.

## API Routes

## Socket Events

### Client to Server

- join_group
- join_notes
- update_note
- send_message

## Environment Variables

Create a .env file in server with:

SERVER ENV

- MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
- JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_secret
- MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
- CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
- PORT=5000
- NODE_ENV=development

Optional client-side env in client/.env:

- VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000

Notes:

- If VITE_SOCKET_URL is not set, client uses window.location.origin.
- Some test scripts reference GEMINI_API_KEY, but runtime AI flow uses Mistral.

## Local Development Setup

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud)

Install dependencies:

1. Install client dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

2. Install server dependencies

```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

Run development:

1. Start backend

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

2. Start frontend in a second terminal

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Frontend default: http://localhost:5173

Backend default: http://localhost:5000

## Production Build Flow (Current Script Behavior)

From server folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:

- Build the client app.
- Move client/dist into server/public.

Then run:

```bash
npm start
```

Backend will serve API and built frontend from the same server.

```

## Notable Implementation Details

- The app uses cookie-based auth instead of Authorization headers.
- Chat file attachments are stored as base64 strings in message records (simple but not ideal for large-scale production).
- AI responses are persisted in browser localStorage for chat continuity.
- Theme preference and active group tab are persisted in localStorage.

## Current Limitations and Improvement Opportunities

- File storage should move to object storage (S3, Cloudinary, etc.) for scalability.
- A centralized root-level script set could improve developer experience for running client and server together.
- Additional validation/rate-limiting around AI and message payload size would improve robustness.
